    "# Exploring the collation of Calpurnius Flaccus\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I present an interactive method to manipulate the collation of the *Declamations* of Calpurnius Flaccus obtained with [CollateX](collatex.net).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the data\n",
    "\n",
    "First it is necessary to understand the structure of the collation data. [Here](http://www.w3resource.com/JSON/structures.php) you can find the generic description of json structures. An object (dictionary) is made of one or more pairs of name/value. The relation name/value is similar to the relation between a word and its definition in a dictionary. An array (list) is an ordered list of values. A json *object* corresponds to a python *dictionary*, and a json *array* to a python *list*. Lists can be combined: a table is a list of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two objects in the json collation, which are converted into their equivalent in python: \n",
    "* a list of witnesses (\"witnesses\")\n",
    "* a table with the aligned text versions (\"table\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of witnesses works as a header for the table, which can be itself described as:\n",
    "* a table is a list of rows\n",
    "* a row is a list of cells\n",
    "* a cell is a list of tokens\n",
    "* a token is a dictionary with the following entries:\n",
    "    * **t : exact word as it appears in the witness**\n",
    "    * n : optional normalized version of the word\n",
    "    * locus : optional exact location of the word in the manuscript/edition. Folio/page number, followed by line number\n",
    "    * note : optional comment \n",
    "    * decl: optional declamation number\n",
    "    * link : optional link to the page of a digital facsimile, where the token appears\n",
    "    \n",
    "The order of the rows is important, because it follows the order of the text. Row 0 has the first word(s) of the text, whereas the last row has also the last word(s) of the text. The row's number is called ID number, and will be used later for variant location identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents <a name=\"ToC\"></a>\n",
    "1. [Import Data](#part1).\n",
    "The first step is to import the collation results into python. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Functions](#part2).\n",
    "Then we will create functions to filter the data according to our need. For instance, we may want to find all the unique variants of one witness. Or we would like to see the places where one group of witnesses agrees with each other against another group of witnesses. Some functions will allow us to diplay only a section of the collation, or information specific to one variant location. Including:\n",
    "  1. [find agreements](#func2-4)\n",
    "  2. [table to html](#func2-6)\n",
    "  3. [move tokens](#func2-10)\n",
    "  4. [add/delete note](#func2-11)\n",
    "  5. [search](#func2-12)\n",
    "  6. [save](#func2-13)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [Exploration of collation](#part3).\n",
    "Finally, we will use our functions to explore the collation of Calpurnius Flaccus, with interactive [widgets](http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html):\n",
    "  1. [Modify](#part3-1) collation (move tokens, add/del rows, add/del notes, save the new json)\n",
    "  2. [Find agreements](#part3-2) between witnesses, and save the result into a more complex html file\n",
    "  3. [Search](#part3-3) the collation\n",
    "  4. [Clarify](#part3-4) a reading\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. [Summary](#summary).\n",
    "Summary of all interactions gathered in one widget for ease of use.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Users may go straight to the [summary](#summary) to start exploring the collation of Calpurnius Flaccus. For those who would prefer to see the code behind the widgets and the various interactions, you can read through the [functions](#part2) or the [interactive widgets](#part3).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook re-use\n",
    "Any JSON output from collateX, with **tokens \"t\"**. The other elements are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some transformations may be needed. For instance:\n",
    " * In collation [import data](#import1-2) :  change the base base text. If you choose to have no base text, change also the description of the \"save_to_html\"  [function](#func2-13).\n",
    " * In the HTML template, title and credits should be updated. The transformation into complex HTML could also be adapted, according to the json model of the new user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Improvements\n",
    "- large amounts of modifications (moving many tokens at the same time)\n",
    "- find and delete empty rows automatically\n",
    "- prevent deletion of non empty rows\n",
    "- avoid moving first/last tokens\n",
    "- edit notes directly\n",
    "- save file with popup window\n",
    "- etc."
