# Visualizing Collation Results
### Visualization and interactive manipulation of the collation results from [CollateX](collatex.net) with a jupyter notebook.


## Content
This repository contains
- **collation results** of the *Declamations* of Calpurnius Flaccus in JSON format
- **jupyter notebook** where it is possible to modify, search or filter the collation, and save the new results
- **HTML alignment tables** to visualize not only variant readings, but also notes, links to digital facsimile, etc.


## The Notebook
The notebook is intended for exploring the collation of Calpurnius Flaccus, with interactive [widgets](http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
It allows users to:
 1. **Modify the collation**: move tokens, add or delete rows, add or del notes, and save the new JSON results
 2. **Filter the collation**: select readings from the collation in order to find unique readings of a witness, select a group of witnesses which agree together
, or find differences between two specific witnesses
 3. **Save HTML tables**: selections of readings can be saved in HTML tables, more comprehensive than the basic tables displaed within the notebook
 3. **Search the collation**
 4. **Clarify a reading**: display information about this reading such as a normalized form of the word, 
the page or folio and line where it appaears in the witness, a link to the digital image of the page when available
